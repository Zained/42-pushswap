# 42-pushswap
Push_Swap

---------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithms :



stack a : nb1 nb2 nb3

stack b : 



The goal is to sort Stack A with limited actions :

swap A (switch 2 first elements top of the stack A).

swap B (switch 2 first elements top of the stack B).

SS (switch A & B on the same time).

Push A (push element on top of A to top of B).

Push B (push element on top of B to top of A).

Rotate A (last become first element, first become second).

Rotate B (last become first element, first become second).

RR (Rotate A & Rotate B).

Reverse Rotate A (first become last).

Reverse Rotate B (first become last).

RRR (RRotate A & RRotate B).
